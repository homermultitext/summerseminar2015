Welcome to the summer, 2015, Homer Multitext seminar at the Center for Hellenic Studies!

Please plan to arrive at the CHS on Monday, June 22. A rotating team of seminar faculty will be waiting to meet you and help orient you to the CHS.  We will have an opening reception that evening and hold our first seminar with the full group on Tuesday morning.  Our last session will be Thursday, July 2.  Friday, July 3, will be open for checkout and travel home.

Throughout the seminar we'll use this web site:  http://homermultitext.github.io/summerseminar2015/

You can find more details there about travel and housing arrangements (http://homermultitext.github.io/summerseminar2015/travel/), as well as an overview of what we'll be doing this summer.

Please do look at the page entitled "Preparation prior to the seminar" (http://homermultitext.github.io/summerseminar2015/prep/).  It would be very helpful if you could email me as soon as possible with the background information requested there.

I look forward to meeting you in Washington!
