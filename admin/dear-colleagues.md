Dear Colleagues,

On behalf of the Homer Multitext team, I'm writing to welcome you to our 2015 summer seminar at the Center for Hellenic Studies.   

This year we will again host teams from Furman University, College of the Holy Cross, Gustavus Adolphus College, University of Houston, Leiden University, Trinity University in San Antonio, and University of Washington. The seminar will run from Monday, June 22, until Friday, July 3, and will focus on Iliad 19 in the Venetus A.  June 22 is a travel day:  as participants arrive during the course of the day, Chris Blackwell, Stephanie Lindeborg and I will meet with you in House A to verify that your laptop has everything we need for the seminar.  We'll have a welcoming reception Monday evening, and begin morning sessions on Tuesday, June 23.  July 3 is likewise a travel day, so that everyone can try to escape Washington, DC, prior to July 4.

Could you please send me as soon as possible names and emails for the team you will be bringing this year?

I look forward to seeing all of you at CHS, and to meeting the next generation of successful multitexters.

Yours,

Neel
