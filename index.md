title: "CHS summer seminar, 2015"
---

The 2015 summer seminar ran from Monday, June 22, to Friday, July 3. 

We recorded presentations from research teams on Thursday, July 2, and hope to make cleaned up versions available on youtube.

All documentation we used during the seminar on how to run the HMT virtual machine and edit material for the HMT project has now been transferred to the growing project documentation site at <http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-docs/>.
