Everyone who has arrived by Monday evening is invited to an informal reception in the Common Room of the CHS main building, beginning at 6:30.  This is primarily a social event and opportunity to meet the other participants, but you should be familiar with at least the [overview of this summer's seminar][ov] on the seminar web site, since we will take a few minutes to orient you to our seminar sessions that begin Friday morning at 9:30.
