## Stephanie's social calendar

1. Friday (26th) - 6:30 end of the week dinner at the main building at CHS (will be Thai food)
2. Saturday (27th) - Will be our main trip to the National Mall, around which are all the major monuments and Smithsonian Museums. The plan is to depart CHS sometime between 9:30 and 10 am and make our way to Dupont Circle where we can catch the subway. It is usually better to do the outdoor monuments in the morning while it is still somewhat cool (although the weather should be less hot this weekend). The area is surrounded by food trucks which are usually a great place to get a cheap lunch. Then during the afternoon we can spend some time in the various Smithsonian museums, which are all free. Based on how the day went last year, it will probably be close to dinner by the time we are heading back on the metro. The Dupont Circle area is full of places to eat, and I would suggest we go out to eat together in the area before walking back to CHS. It’s totally up to you guys.
3.  Sunday (28th) - Some people have expressed an interest in going to the National Zoo (also free because it is part of the Smithsonian). It’s about a 25-30 minute walk from CHS. We can talk more about what time we want to go.
4.  Monday (29th) - Bar Trivia at Breadsoda. Trivia starts at 7:30. I plan on getting dinner at the bar, so I plan to leave around 6:30. It is a short walk through the woods and down Wisconsin Ave. 
5.  Tuesday (30th) - House F has kindly agreed to host our potluck dinner. More details on exact time will be forthcoming, but please block out Tuesday night for a fun evening.
6.  Thursday (2nd) - 6:30 Closing Dinner
