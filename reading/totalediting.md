# The "total editing" approach #

## Citation ##

The HMT project cites texts using the CTS URN notation.  

- Skim through the [HMT technical documentation on CTS URN](http://katoptron.holycross.edu/hmt-doc/cite/cts-urn-overview.html).  Don't get too distracted by technical references you're not familiar with:  make sure you understand the main concepts.
- Try out [these live examples of CTS URNs](http://cts-demo.appspot.com/demo/examples).  Compare the citation with the text it retrieves, and be sure you understand how the practical examples work.

## Editing ##

The HMT project is defining new standards for editing texts in a digital environment.  The "total editing approach" we have adopted includes the following characteristics:

1. Explicit model of relations of text to artifact.  We are editing specific versions of texts that are preserved for us on specific physical artifacts.  It's essential for us to specify how the text and artifact are related to each.
2.  All observations are expressed using URN notation to refer to citable objects.  Our editorial work is not dependent on any particular technology.  Our URN notation can be automatically interpreted by software, but can be used by itself outside of any particular technological system.
3. All observations documented with visual evidence.  Editing is an act of interpretation.  When we claim we can see or read a text on an artifact, we must support this claim with a citation of the visual evidence on which we base that claim.
4. We create *diplomatic* editions.  Diplomatic editions record exactly what we read on a text.  We do not correct "errors" by the scribe, or try to suggest what we think the "true" reading ought to be.  We can only suggest that a reading is in error or should be changed by referring to the text we actually are able to see in our source.
5. *Every* textual mark and non-textual graphic mark is accounted for.  Our digital edition must represent *all* the information that the scribes chose to include in the manuscripts.  We cannot be selective in what evidence we publish if we aim to understand systematically how the manuscripts were created.
