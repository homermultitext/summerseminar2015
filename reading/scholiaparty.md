# Scholia reading party #

(including video conference with Holy Cross researchers) 

Each group will bring one or two examples of scholia they have worked on.   You should choose scholia that you want feedback on:  either because you think they are particularly interesting, and may be worth investigating further in a short research project, or because  you think they are particularly difficult and you want to bring in more people to help reading them.

Please plan to add to your "writing" folder a (potentially very short) citedown file with all the references you know would like to pull up in discussing your scholion.
