Assigned reading:

- Background on the scholia and the language of the scholia:  read Dickey, *Ancient Greek Scholarship* 106-112.  
- Greek numerals:  Dickey, 131-132.
- Bird, "Critical Signs," chapter 5 in *Recapturing a Homeric Legacy* (available from Sakai)

Practice scholia reading!

- In Dickey, page 150, look over her examples numbered 37-40, and compare  her "key" to those scholia on p. 179.
Recommended:

- Then, skim the list of topics covered in Dickey 112-130, so you can look up her discussion if (when?) you run across one of those issues in your editiorial work.
