# The Venetus A manuscript #

Please read Allen's classic description of the Venetus A in his article "On the Composition of Some Greek Manuscripts" (available from Sakai).  

What does he consider worth describing? Are there ay categories of information in his article that are not represented in HMT's digital recording?

Be prepared to compare Allen's published information with the kinds of information you are recording in your TEI XML edition of *Iliad* and scholia.
