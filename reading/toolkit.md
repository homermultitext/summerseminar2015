- "[Github is going mainstream][wired]" (a dozen cool examples largely pillaged from the wired article in "[Twelve things other than programming code that are managed on GitHub][gh12]").  If you're thinking about how this might work in an academic career, see [this piece in profhack](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/file-and-repository-history-in-github/48047)
- from [writing on github with markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/), please read "[Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)"
